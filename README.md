# meatray_fleet
New graphics rendering box, and a silly demo to drive the will to develop.

#theatre
A system to combine shapes and textures to make more advanced objects.  Uses VBOs.

#fleet
Just a couple of spaceships made of shapes that will follow paths.  Eventually want to make little FTL style damage control simulator.
